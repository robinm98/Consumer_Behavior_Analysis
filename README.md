This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior regarding air travel upgrades, specifically through a machine learning comparative analysis using R and Python. The study applies Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network models to predict airline passenger preferences for additional services. The project employs a multi-label prediction approach, where the goal is to simultaneously forecast whether a passenger will opt for an extra baggage allowance, a preferred seat, or an in-flight meal.
