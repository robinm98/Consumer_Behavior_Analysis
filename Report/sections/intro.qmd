# Introduction

## Overview and Motivation

In the fast-paced world of air travel, airlines face a dual challenge: maintaining operational efficiency while personalizing the travel experience for their passengers. Key aspects that greatly influence passenger satisfaction include baggage handling, preferred seating, and in-flight meals. Each of these elements represents significant opportunities for airlines to enhance customer experiences and optimize their ancillary services.

The project aims to harness machine learning to predict and analyze passengers' choices regarding baggage, preferred seating, and in-flight meal options. By examining a range of influencing factors, such as trip duration and purpose, the project seeks to generate actionable insights that airlines can use to improve operational efficiency and tailor their services to individual customer preferences.

Our motivation stems from the logistical and customer service challenges faced by airlines when handling passengers’ preferences efficiently. Accurate prediction models will help airlines anticipate the demand for different services, from baggage needs to specific seating and meal preferences. This, in turn, will allow them to allocate resources more effectively and design better marketing strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and maximizing revenue from ancillary services.

## Data

Our project's dataset, titled "Airlines Booking" and compiled by _Anand Shaw_, is sourced from Kaggle. This CSV file encompasses anonymized airline booking records, capturing a diverse array of passenger information. The data includes specifics such as flight details, baggage choices, seating preferences, and in-flight meal options. With records from 50,000 users of the ticket booking portal across 14 distinct columns, this extensive dataset serves as the cornerstone for analyzing and discerning patterns in air traveler preferences. The dataset is available for access on Kaggle.


## Related Work

Research on passenger preferences in air travel has highlighted several factors influencing travelers' choices and behaviors, notably service offerings like baggage handling, seat selection, and in-flight meal preferences. Add-on revenues, such as those from baggage fees, preferred seating, and in-flight services, have become essential for airline profitability [1]. The growth in these revenue streams underscores their importance in airline strategies, as ancillary revenues accounted for about 18% of total airline revenue in 2022 [2].

**Baggage Preferences:**

Studies indicate that baggage fees and policies greatly affect customer behavior. Clear communication about baggage policies can influence booking decisions, and flexibility in these policies can enhance customer loyalty. Research shows that ancillary baggage fees impact travelers’ booking choices and willingness to pay [3], suggesting that transparent and adaptable baggage policies are crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction [3].

**Preferred Seating:**

Seat selection is critical for passenger comfort and satisfaction. Passengers value different seat attributes, such as proximity to exits, windows, or aisles, depending on their preferences. Research indicates that passengers are willing to pay extra for preferred seating, which underscores the importance of predictive models to cater to these preferences [4]. This willingness to pay highlights the revenue potential for airlines from charging for preferred seating [4].

**In-Flight Meals:**

The diversity in passengers' dietary and cultural preferences necessitates a variety of meal options to meet these needs. Studies show that offering diverse in-flight meal options can significantly improve passenger satisfaction [5]. Airlines that effectively address these preferences can differentiate their services, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty[5].


In summary, the research on passenger preferences in air travel highlights the critical role of add-on revenues such as baggage fees, preferred seating, and in-flight services. These elements not only significantly impact customer satisfaction but also contribute substantially to airline profitability. Clear communication and flexibility in baggage policies are essential for influencing booking decisions and enhancing customer loyalty. The willingness of passengers to pay extra for preferred seating and diverse in-flight meal options underscores the need for airlines to offer tailored services that meet diverse passenger preferences, ultimately driving higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

## Research questions

Our study, "Modeling Passenger Preferences for Air Travel Upgrades," focuses on developing predictive models to determine passenger choices for additional services during air travel and determining the response of the three upgrade classes simultaneously for each individual, employing multi-class modeling to capture the comprehensive preferences of passengers. The central research question explores the application of machine learning:

**How can machine learning models utilize passenger demographic and trip-specific data to predict preferences for air travel upgrades such as extra baggage, preferred seating, and in-flight meals?**

This question aims to uncover the potential of using various data points to accurately forecast which upgrades passengers are most likely to select, thereby enhancing personalized service delivery and operational efficiency.

In this report, we will start with exploring the structure of our data. Then, we will do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying structure and key patterns within the dataset. Following EDA, we will employ Unsupervised Learning techniques to uncover hidden structures and groupings in the data. Next, we will detail the Methodology of our Supervised Learning approaches, outlining the models used and the rationale behind their selection. We will then present the Results of our analysis, highlighting the performance of different models and key findings. Finally, we will conclude with a Conclusion, summarizing the insights gained and potential implications for airline operations and customer satisfaction.
