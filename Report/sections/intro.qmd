# Introduction

* Overview and Motivation

In the fast-paced world of air travel, airlines face a dual challenge: maintaining operational efficiency while personalizing the travel experience for their passengers. Key aspects that greatly influence passenger satisfaction include baggage handling, preferred seating, and in-flight meals. Each of these elements represents significant opportunities for airlines to enhance customer experiences and optimize their ancillary services.

The project aims to harness machine learning to predict and analyze passengers' choices regarding baggage, preferred seating, and in-flight meal options. By examining a range of influencing factors, such as trip duration and purpose, the project seeks to generate actionable insights that airlines can use to improve operational efficiency and tailor their services to individual customer preferences.

Our motivation stems from the logistical and customer service challenges faced by airlines when handling passengersâ€™ preferences efficiently. Accurate prediction models will help airlines anticipate the demand for different services, from baggage needs to specific seating and meal preferences. This, in turn, will allow them to allocate resources more effectively and design better marketing strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and maximizing revenue from ancillary services.

* Data

The dataset for our project is sourced from Kaggle and titled "Airlines Booking", compiled by user Anand Shaw. It is presented as a CSV file containing anonymized airline booking records, capturing a wide range of passenger data including flight details, baggage choices, preferred seat selection, and in-flight meal preferences. This comprehensive dataset provides the foundational data needed to analyze and understand the various preferences of air travelers, allowing us to identify patterns and predict future preferences. The dataset is accessible via Kaggle.
